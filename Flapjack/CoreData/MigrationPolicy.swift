/**
 A common subclass for "hooking in" to the existing Core Data APIs for handling mapping model migrations in order to
 make them Swift-y and much easier to deal with.

 Subclasses must override the `migrations` property, where keys should be the _names_ of the mappings (like
 `PlaylistToPlaylist`), and the _values_ should be the properties vending functions to run.

 See the docstring for `migrations` for more information.
